## the Karenization of the consumer 

We’re all familiar with the “Can I speak to the manager?” Karens that we know and love. Most of us are aware of this phenomenon — a white woman taking advantage of her privilege to unreasonably dispute about a subpar (or slightly flawed) service. This is significantly problematic for various reasons (reinforcing socioeconomic disparities, targeting essential workers and small businesses, etc.), but in the context of consuming products and services, Karens aren’t too far off from the normal customer.

As a customer, we have a similar privilege in a way. In the early 20th century, the phrase ‘The customer is always right’ was pioneered by successful retailers whose companies grew really quickly by operating with this idea. Throughout the growth of products and services since then, companies have gotten a lot better at appeasing us and making our lives as easy as possible. Not only through systems like customer service, quick repairs/replacements, and reimbursements, but also through products themselves — perfected through hundreds of iterations to adjust to our every need and preference. Thanks to globalization and easy shipping, products don’t need to respond to geographical factors at all, and they can be increasingly refined to a niche target market, no matter how spread out everyone is. There’s a shampoo out there that has been optimized for your exact needs and preferred experience, because you’re the specific user a company focused on. So, we have perfect products, and if something goes wrong with the product, we have perfect systems to rely on that make us feel like we still got our money’s worth. This has resulted in our subsequent Karenization, because we’re increasingly fragile, dependent, and demanding. The phenomenons I’ve thought a lot about are:

💵 We’ve internalized the expectation that we’re owed if something breaks.
With products or services, once we send our money, we’re expecting something deterministic, functional, and standard in return (not including sketchy online shopping sites). We’re always expecting to have our way, and if that doesn’t happen, it’s inherently unjust, because we wasted our money. If anything goes wrong with what we’ve been given, the company is in debt to us. Thanks to the systems in place like warranties or free replacements, we’ve been conditioned to expect that we’ll be recompensed for our losses, maybe even come out winning because we get a cool new version of our product.

The problem, and it’s something I’ve become conscious of myself, is that we’ve internalized this mindset and apply it to other things in our lives. For the things that we don’t buy with money, we buy them with other resources: time, effort, emotional/mental energy, etc. and we tend to expect that we’ll get our “money’s” worth. If something breaks in life, and we don’t get recompensed, we feel cheated. Whether it’s still feeling tired after a long night of sleep, or failing a test even after we spent blood, sweat, and tears studying for it, these things all feel 10x more frustrating simply because we expended a lot of resources compared to the results obtained. Our happiness is largely based on our expectations for outcomes and experiences, and our internalized consumer mindset has caused us to constantly set expectations for what we get in life — expectations that end up placing a deterministic lens on things that in reality are much more influenced by randomness. So, we experience more disappointment in life. Even more, we develop a victim complex because we feel cheated by life, and so when we fail, we attribute more blame to these happenings because we see ourselves as victims of injustice.

🛠 We subconsciously assume that we don’t have to work to fix things ourselves.
Waiting hours on customer service because I’m too lazy to figure out how to fix something myself? Heck yea. I’m gonna let the product support specialists do their thing. And if it still doesn’t work, I get a free replacement anyways. If only I had product support specialists to fix my broken sleep schedule — that would be game changing. But alas, it’s only in the fantasy capitalism world that we pretty much never have to stress when things break.

We’ve been spoiled by these systems and I find that they cause us to have less and less patience and initiative to solve things in our own lives. Our default is inaction, because in our current economy, things just kinda flow to us and the only thing we have to do is press buttons and slap on return address labels. When it comes to things like fixing broken relationships, for example, these things take time and the process is not optimized. In fact, it’s intentionally not optimized; if it was optimized, the resulting relationship wouldn’t be as meaningful because very little effort was placed into fixing it. Kinda like apologizing to someone: the more thought, time, and effort you spend crafting and delivering the apology, the more effective it is in fixing broken trust. As modern consumers, we’ve trained our brain to assume that things should be easy to fix, and there’s cognitive dissonance when things turn out very hard to fix.

🪄 In our privileged consumer world, we’ve become more fragile because we are less and less exposed to problems, harm, and pain.

Yes, you could say that we’ve replaced our ancestor’s problems of hunting for food and finding shelter with modern problems like choosing an instagram caption and finding a Netflix show, but the problems we face on a daily basis now are cumulatively relatively easier to solve than what we used to face before the rise in consumerism (I say cumulatively because there are still some very hard things present, especially with less economic privilege). By challenging problems, I mean the ones that require objectively larger amounts of mental, emotional, and physical effort. Products and services are increasingly optimized to mitigate friction and pain-points, making our day-to-day smoother and smoother.

Optimized user experiences, whether a UI on a social media app or a door knob, continuously lower our tolerance for struggle and discomfort. Even more, many products and services are engineered to keep humans from using the product incorrectly so that we further avoid harm. Take sink garbage disposal units for example: many models are designed so that there’s a sink plug that you have to put in before it can run. Even though this makes the primary user experience a little more bumpy, it makes for an overall, consistently harm-free experience even if things don’t go exactly as planned. We’re like babies in a room full of child-proofed furniture and toys.

In reality, the real world is not perfectly engineered for us. The user experience has not been refined to cater to every need and eliminate every risk. But, we’re less and less prepared for it because of the products and services we constantly use to make our daily lives easier.

📈 We’re becoming more fragile in the short term as we use our current products, but also in the long term as innovation continues.

Thanks to our global markets, increasing connectivity, and the internet, products can increasingly build off of each other. Product X takes the brunt of the failures, customer complaints, and shortcomings, and then product Y builds off of that, not just if it’s physically made using Product X components but also if it’s completely unrelated, because of transferable knowledge and learnings. One random customer’s pain is the peak of customer pain for that product and for subsequent products. So, we’re becoming more and more fragile as the years go on.

the flaws in products and services decrease thanks to a) iteration, hence the step function and b) compounded learnings, hence the lines starting at lower y’s for subsequent products
How to de-consumer ourselves 🌱

In addition to relationships and friendships, there’s tons of other things in life that are hard to deal with and hard to fix. One huge one is ourselves. There’s no human apple store we can stroll into for help (unless… therapy clinic but make it apple genius bar for humans?). It’s so easy to procrastinate working on ourselves when we’re increasingly used to abandoning problems if there’s no easy fix. I wouldn’t consider ourselves “broken” ever, but there are bugs in our systems that can keep us from getting to our goals, such as insecurities or bad habits. Any easy fix is just a bandaid solution, and work on ourselves takes effort and time (cue one of my favorite books that explains how to improve yourself from the ground up, 7 habits of highly effective people). Our day to day user experience in life, not just with ourselves, is incredibly chaotic, and the opposite of optimized, even with products and services that are making it easier in some senses.
So how can we change our mindset so that we don’t approach the things that matter as a Karenized consumer, dependent and demanding? It comes down to constantly seeing these things as organic, not inorganic and manufactured.

To think about this initially, I thought about what we generally treat the opposite way as we treat products and services. Things that we expect probably won’t work perfectly and that will need a lot of continuously invested effort and time. A solid example for me: plants. Spoiler alert, I have no green thumb whatsoever and I’ve definitely accidentally killed too many plants I was supposed to take care of. Plants are needy — they get sick or die for random reasons, and they require constant thoughtful care and attention. When we get a plant, we understand that we’re fully responsible for it and we come in with the expectations that 1) it’s on us to figure out how to help it grow and recover from sicknesses, 2) things might go wrong with it at literally any point. Our brain goes into responsibility and initiative mode and prepares for something difficult.

The reason we see plants this way is because of their organic nature. We see complex systems inherently different as simple systems, which means we understand that a plant can have exponentially more randomness than an engineered product. We’re also fully aware that organic systems can’t be engineered, whereas a nonorganic product or service can be engineered and optimized down to every point of the UI/UX. So, we expect that plants haven’t been perfectly optimized for our use and aren’t controlled to avoid unwanted outcomes. Even though we do put money into buying plants, we don’t expect that that money implies that our work/discomfort has been cut down somehow. With products and services, the more money we put into something, the easier we expect things to be, because we’re paying for an engineered solution for a pain point.

When we start seeing things in our lives as plants that need water, care, and patience, we take more initiative and we’re more prepared for the ups and downs of life. Whether it’s a team we’re leading, or our family, or a project we’re working on, we need to remember that these are all things that are organic and complex. If they were inorganic, our capitalistic market would have already figured out a way to engineer them so that they’re easy and quick (e.g. Facebook attempting to engineer friendships for us). In response to the first four phenomena we explored at the beginning…

We need to internalize the expectation that we’re not really owed anything if something breaks. Instead of victimizing ourselves by thinking about things that “happen” to us, let’s think about failures and crises as opportunities for us. Every road-bump is a chance for us to learn, grow, or make something in our life even stronger.

We need to assume that we have to work to fix and maintain things ourselves if we care about them. Though some things are fixed with time, this process still requires us to do difficult system 2 things, such as control our emotions, analyze alternatives, and figure out the best way to fix things. Everything else probably requires thoughtful and consistent effort over time, like watering a plant a little bit every day.

Let’s push back against our privileged consumerism and continue seeking discomfort. Taleb’s concept of anti-fragility is such a good framework for this. In order to keep growing, we need to take risks and get out of our comfort zone. Whether this is on a large scale, such as choosing a career with more variability, or on a small scale, such as taking cold showers sometimes, we could always benefit from more difficulty. When deciding between getting the real plant and the fake plant, let’s try to choose the real plant more often.

As products and services get better and better at making things easy, it’s more and more crucial to choose the real plant more often. We need to balance efficiency (relying on products and services) with growth (choosing things that are difficult). Yes, we can rely on perfectly optimized personal assistants and GPS’s and personalized tools when we need it; the advancements of society definitely empower us with freedom and time. But — let’s hit the gym and lift the weights when we can. Put aside the GPS one day, turn off the personal assistant another day. Making things harder for ourselves sometimes will help us train in plant-caretaker mode: at our full potential in creativity, initiative, and anti-fragility.
