    thanks: `This project was exciting to me because of the potential for it to transform the no-code/low-code space
    and because of the interesting challenges it has in refining the algorithm and harnessing GPT-3 in the right ways.
    I've also learned a ton working with Alex Gu, who has taught me how to ask the right research questions and build 
    creative programs to test hypotheses.`,
