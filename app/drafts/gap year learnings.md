5 weeks into my 2021 fall semester:

- Grad dorm life because MIT didn't have space for me in undergrad housing anymore
- Email in my inbox from a concerned prof. whose class I forgot I had to take this semester
- Mid-identity crisis, going to sophomore formal and approaching different friend groups to attempt to make friends

_record scratch_
Yep, that's me. You're probably wondering how I ended up in this situation.

Even though I was a royal mess this semester, I'm so incredibly thankful for the year I had before coming back to school. Taking a gap year was a privilege, especially during the remote school year, and with the state of the world and series of tragedies, it was even more of a privilege to have had an overall great year.

Someone asked me the other day what I've learned from MIT, and it caught me off guard. If you had asked me at the end of freshman year, I probably would have had a lot to say about how to make career choices, how to make friends in a completely new environment, etc. But my year _away_ from MIT helped me grow and learn so much, that in my mind those learnings were the only ones that were really relevant. Here goes an effort to preserve the main things I learned (not as much to share-- because I strongly think every person should take a gap year to learn things like these on their own!!). I learned a ton about society, people, communities, tech, etc., which I'll probably write essays about later, but for now I'll focus on life learnings, which personally impacted me the most.

### how it all went down

Turning back time to August, 2020, I was preparing mentally for a semester of virtual classes, but making the best out of the situation and thinking about how I'd get to hang out in person with people my age after a 3 month quarantine style summer in the suburbs of FL with my parents. I also agreed on a whim to sign a year-long lease for an apartment with a couple of friends since I found a $700 monthly rent my summer internship money could cover, and so my year was set out for me in Boston. My close friend Sofia from Yale had decided to take a gap year, but I didn't really consider it because I had reasoned myself into being happy about my current plan. Plus, I didn't know of anyone taking time off from MIT-- everyone was on the same page about just kinda getting college over with.

> Constantly reimagine your life

    My comfy situation was a tragic case of design fixation with my life, where I was finding ways to make it slightly better but I didn't consider how I could completely redesign my situation from scratch. We're subconsciously anchored to so many things; what our friends are doing, what our family expects, what we've already been investing time and resources into. If we're privileged, our basic needs are probably covered enough to the point where complacency rules over risk-taking. As important as it is to be actively grateful about your situation daily, I think it's equally important to constantly take a step back and analyze what your ideal situation is and if you can start building it now.

One day a LinkedIn DM popped in from someone named Coco, a junior at Yale, about an entrepreneurship program called Womxn Ignite. I remembered hearing about it earlier in the summer from one of my interviewers for a program, Ali Partovi, one of my biggest role models, but even then it had still stayed in the "this is cool" area of my mind but not the "I should do this" area. It's always the second time you hear about something, when you're already a bit familiar with it, that your brain decides to pay attention to it.

When I explain to other people what Womxn Ignite was, I say I was "living with 19 people I didn't know before in the middle of a forest", which is hilarious to me because it sounds so bizzare to other people but the aspects that sound bizzare were the ones I considered the least. I didn't really consider the fact that I didn't know anyone, or that it was in the middle of nowhere. My risk analysis mostly consisted of "will I be productive enough"/ "will I be learning as much," since the looming factor in my mind was the opportunity cost of not doing MIT. The program was technically limited to juniors and seniors, which in my mind checked the "pushing myself enough" box since I was a sophomore, and it seemed structured enough to enforce my productivity. Over ambitious, toxic productivity type beat leftover from my highschool self. But in addition to that, I was also super stoked to finally have time to focus full-time on a startup.

The last factor that pushed me to take the jump was my interview with Coco and Kendall. Their energy was infectious and I felt so genuinely excited that I even got to meet them. For a zoom call to give me energy instead of drain it - there was something there. After this, it was obvious to me that I had to go for it. Over the next week, I found a subletter for my apartment last minute and bought new plane tickets.

### womxn ignite (aug - nov)

We all congregated in a town called Philo, California-- a town with 0 covid cases, weekly drive in movies, wine tastings everywhere, and large stretches of forest and farms. Because no one was having weddings at the time, we took over a wedding location and flipped it into an incubator with an office space, whiteboards, and endless sticky notes (props to Coco and Kendall for setting up the dopest Silicon Valley show remake).

> The first thing I learned during these months was that I definitely want to go all in on my own startup at some point.

    During college, it was hard to tell; working on side projects is stressful when you have 10 different things on your plate and push like 10 lines of code a week. These months allowed me to focus all my energy on building towards a vision I was excited about. It was hard but rewarding; recruiting a third teammate to work with us, jumping on over 30 in-depth calls with students and recruiters, making sense out of a million ideas/pain-points, and figuring out where to start. Fully focusing on a project gave me so much more energy to work on it, because of the daily moments like coming up with a cool feature idea over a lunch convo, talking to someone else about our vision for changing society, or hearing from a potential customer that they wanted to be the first to use our platform when we launched. I can't even imagine how energizing it must be to be able to jump head-first into a project with not just full focus but also no looming "return to college" pending.

Outside the startup work, I stayed connected to my MIT communities, bringing companies to talk for one of my hispanic student clubs and leading the semester-long education program for our entrepreneurship club.

One other fun part of my forest adventures was continuing to practice piano so that I could continue with the MIT piano program. A two-week shipping period after ordering, I received my electronic weighted piano keyboard and set it up in a shack outside our office space with a heavy-duty extension cord. Practice involved many nights staying later the rest, afterwards walking back alone to my cabin through the pitch black forest and along the highway up to my cabin. Once a week, early in the crisp, cold morning before the others arrived, I'd prepare the whole shack setup for optimal viewing and sound and have a virtual lesson with my teacher. Halfway through Womxn Ignite, we went on retreat to a summer camp location further south in CA, and there came with the piano with me. I felt like a little kid with everyone else being the supportive parents making sure I could keep up with my afterschool activiies.

> Keeping up hobbies / routines will never seem convenient a lot of the time.

    In college, part of our tuition pays for ultimate convenience for everything; dining halls, gyms, practice rooms, study spaces, etc. in walking distance. It's natural to form routine and forget about most life factors like inconveniencing others or dealing with unexpected traffic/events. This makes it really hard, outisde of college, to rationalize sticking with routines or hobbies when everything seems so unstructured and chaotic, like it's never the right time, or place, or situation to do things in. It's even easier to push things off when you have this as an excuse, kinda like pushing off reading because you're waiting for that perfect hour when you can sit down with a cup of tea and a blanket and read (even though that will never arrive). I learned that if something matters to me, convenience should be irrelevant (to an extent that doesn't harm others). This involves either 1) building structure so that it _feels_ more convenient or 2) doing whatever possible to get it done no matter the inconvenience. The former means setting a time to do it every day, or finding an accountability partner, or preparing everything in my piano shack so that I'm more willing to practice when it comes time. Things that make our brain say "hey! it seems like it's a good time to do _this_." The latter means, if there's no way to mitigate the lonely walk home after practice, practice is non-negotiable either way and I need to do whatever possible to get it done every day.

The rest of the life story of the gap year piano: Packed it the last day, couldn't find a postal office open. Locals thought I was trying to ship drugs. Finally found someone to ship it for me. In Boston, it almost got returned to sender but the truck was delayed so I got there in time to rescue it at the postal office. Its life came to a tragic close when a roommate unknowingly threw it away. It had an honorable 1-year run :')

The highlight of Womxn Ignite was definitely the people - every single person I was living with was incredibly curious, driven, passionate, and kind. Every meal featured both intellectual and vulnerable conversations. We could go from talking about AI literacy to talking about our childhood experiences to talking about our ideal future cities. Every week, we'd have a "plate" (platonic date): a hangout with a random member from the group where we could get to know each other even better.

> I learned was how to form bonds with people.

    This was an opportunity for me to go from 0 to 1, strangers to incredibly close friends, with 20 individuals, all of which I really vibed with, and I was able to truly understand how to navigate the process.
    - I learned to tailor conversations less to the other person and more to what I'm excited to talk about. The people who I want as friends will reciprocate, whether the conversation is intellectual, deep, imaginative, fun, etc. This also means being vulnerable first, which has opened more doors for meaningful relationships that I thought it could.
    - However, most of the time during conversations, I listened and asked questions. I learned to probe shamelessly and find what topics make the other person tick, whether it's their family backgrounds, their hobbies, or their music interests. I cut through small talk and get straight to the stuff that builds meaning and bonds.
    - Probably also due to maturing past "relatable, cool teen" stage, but I learned to deflect less and have more real talk. High school me perfected the art of responding with memes/vine references or just cracking jokes to keep the vibes light. For group convos that usually flies, but for 1:1 convos I instead learned to actually talk about human things and thoughts and experiences without worrying about being boring.

The last day, we had a reflection period that lasted half the day. Tears were shed, hugs were had, and hair caught on fire (candle gone wrong). We each gave a speech to the group about how the experience had shaped us, and every single person chose to talk specifically about how the people had impacted them. Lidia went around and talked about each person's "superpower" and how each one was now a hat she would have ready to wear whenever she needed. Mine was about the specific memory I had with each person in which I felt suddenly closer to them. People talked about being "empowered," being "ignited." Like everyone else, I came out of these months at such a high point in life - deeply inspired and invigorated by a set of new, deep friendships I knew I could count on.

When thinking about the next semester, I had planned to return to classes right after Womxn Ignite, but the slippery slope had been slipped down. My second time applying to Facebook SWE, I got an offer and was able to secure it for spring, justifying my second semester off from school.

### boston / facebook swe (dec - april)

- building a home takes time

- loneliness

- how to keep growing in different ways

- to focus on forming meaningful bonds

- forming routine

After CA I flew to Boston to finally make some use out of the apartment, with a super fun roommate named Rachel who was doing condom research at MIT, so we had some nice dildo decor around the apartment. I moved in and played house by buying all the kitchen stuff I needed. With Trader Joe's right next to my apartment, I learned to make dishes like savory stir fry and creamy pastas. My friend Kameron invited me over to his friendsgiving with his living group and we cooked the whole day and laughed nonstop. I spent my birthday with one of my closest friends, walking around Boston Seaport and dancing bachata in the park. A friend from back home visited and we played outdoors basketball at midnight and nerded out about space at the Boston science museum and planetarium. I had never felt like more of an adult, choosing exactly how to spend my time and with who. My social life was no longer a cadence of college parties and sorority events but rather a collage of unique moments spent getting to know my closest friends 1:1.

Before coming back to Boston after, I spent the holidays in Colombia, playing chess with my dad and Parcheesi with my grandparents and exploring farms with my cousins. I met someone lovely who treated me well and matched my energy for music and startups, and we started a long distance relationship after I left Colombia.
